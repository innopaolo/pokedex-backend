# Gary Oak's Pokedex backend

## powered with Node.js, Express, and SQL

\*\*Note: this branch has server.mjs in the root folder. The created database on rebuild will also be in the root folder as a consequence. This branch is only intended for the online hosted version of this web app.

This is the server from where the repo garys-pokedex will get its data from. Make sure to download this together with garys-pokedex to make sure the project works. If you want to run this locally, make sure to run `npm install` when you are at the folder in your terminal, to fetch all required dependencies. Instructions on how to use [here](https://github.com/innopaolo/garys-pokedex).
